        Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer and a designer. I am fully self tought,
        everything I know I learned on my own. I usually work with ReactJS
        /NextJS and Chakra UI for front end. I have work with other languages

        hobby. Though if you want any work from me, feel free to contact me.
